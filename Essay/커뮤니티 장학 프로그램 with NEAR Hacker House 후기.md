# 커뮤니티 장학 프로그램 with NEAR Hacker House 후기

As a non-major, I completed Code States SEB 33. Currently, I'm working as a backend developer in a blockchain startup offering NFT solution and a blockchain platform, and studying with an interest in blockchain and Web3.

As someone who enjoys participating in the CodeStates community, I found an announcement that caught my attention. CodeStates was recruiting people to participate in the ‘Community Scholarship Program with NEAR Hacker House’. It was attractive because only a total of 4 people were selected, 2 each in San Francisco and Austin, and it included round-trip airfare, accommodation, and blockchain conference tickets.

I filled out the application honestly and was fortunately selected for the San Francisco schedule. We participated in Graph Day (June 2) and Graph Hack (June 3 - June 5) from June 1 (Wednesday) to June 7 (Tuesday) in San Francisco. I would like to share my feelings on this short opportunity.

If you are a developer, you may have a desire to work in a foreign country (especially Silicon Valley) at least once. I dream of working in Silicon Valley someday, too. But the word 'someday' was always attached. I’m well aware that the idea of the distant future is still there, and I’m not dreaming of it in detail.

With this opportunity, my still fuzzy goal has become a little clearer. Previously, if the destination was trapped in a fog, it feels like the fog has lifted a little. For me, the fact that I was active globally for the first time as a developer was of great significance, and I was able to gain confidence through my challenges. However, on the contrary, I met a big wall called 'English' and it seemed like the fog was over me again.

I usually invest at least 30 minutes a day in studying English. I have a belief that this time will work as a compound interest if I develop my self-improvement consistently even though it is a short time. I indeed had confidence in the steady practice I had been doing until I arrived in San Francisco. But my English was very poor. Simple listening and speaking were possible, but it was difficult to understand complex content, and it was more difficult to get the words out.

At the Graph Day site, there was time to network with various developers who are interested in Web3 from all over the world. But I couldn't approach them with confidence. because I couldn't understand technical explanations in english.

Shawn, who went to San Francisco with me, was very fluent in English, and I admired him for it. Thankfully, Shawn sometimes translates difficult content. The idea that I should devote my energy to improving my English skills as much as my development skills ran through my head the whole time I was in San Francisco. I promise myself that I will never again feel the series of emotions I felt this time.

In Graph Hack we had to create a Web3 service within 3 days. Jodan from LA, Payton from Seattle, Shawn, Austin, and SeungWook from Korea, and We developed the ‘Guess To Earn’ COzA service, a solution to reduce carbon emissions. I was concerned about whether it would be possible to develop in time, but I remember that development took only one night, excluding planning.

The ‘Guess To Earn’ COzA service created by us is a system that gives tokens if you solve a quiz about how much carbon emission can be saved by services such as ‘Move To Earn’ (namely StepN). It was planned to create an opportunity to think about the environment at least once. It’s composed of logic that forms a token economy based on the NEAR protocol, transmits data of blockchain services with Graph, and executes smart contracts on the NestJS backend server.

Below is the Github address of the Dapp we created.

Unfortunately, we didn't win, but it was a good opportunity to learn more about web3. Through this opportunity, I plan to continue my efforts to become a global web3 talent. Thank you to all Near, codeState and stateDAO officials for giving me this opportunity and to Jodan, Payton, Shawn, Austin, and Seungwook.
